== Notes

Some notes made as working through tests.

=== XML data match
The python version just did a string match of normalised data. By normalised - strip out some values - e.g dtstamp, parse the response and the test data and compare the resulting string representation.

This will fail if one has fields in a different namespace - the XMLelement may have extra namespaces defined.

Raises the question of how clients handle extra unknown elements. I woudl say they should ignore them but I'm not sure that's stated anywhere.

Also need to say the same for json.

=== Absence of result tests
Theer are some tests trying to ensure something does NOT show up, e.g. an invite in the inbox when a per-user value is changed.

These tests don't work or have little value - because there may be a delay before it does turn up.
