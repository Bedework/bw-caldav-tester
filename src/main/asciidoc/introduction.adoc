== Introduction

The tester is a java app that will run a series of scripted tests
against a CalDAV or CardDAV server and verify the output, and optionally measure
the time taken to complete one or more repeated requests. The tests are
defined by XML files and ancillary HTTP request body files. A number of
different verification options are provided.

Many tests are included in this package.

The DAV tester can be extended to run tests against almost any type of HTTP server protocol by simply defining a new set of XML files.
